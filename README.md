## Abstract :bookmark: 
Project depclean is a tool to automatically remove dependencies that are included in the dependency tree of java
projects but are not used in the code. It detects and removes all the unused dependencies declared in the pom.xml file
of the project or imported from its parent pom.xml. This tool can only be used in maven-based java project only.
For more information [visit here](https://github.com/castor-software/depclean#readme)

## Goals :dart: 
- Previously depclean was confined only to maven-based java project, but due to increasing popularity of Gradle, 
  the project requires a feature so that depclean could be used on gradle-based java projects too. So, my main goal
  for the project was to implement a depclean-gradle plugin so that the tool depclean could analyze gradle projects.
- Secondly, the existing depclean maven plugin was failing on the multi-module maven project i.e. the plugin was not
  providing the correct output when there are dependent modules inside a multi-module maven project. So my second goal
  was to fix this bug.
- My third and the last goal was to implement some new tests for the depclean-core and depclean maven plugin.

## Results :rocket:
Now the project depclean has a gradle plugin just like maven one, which can analyze and debloat out the unused 
dependencies from a gradle-based java project too. It also has all the optional parameter which was present in depclean
gradle maven-plugin. Also, I fixed the multi-module bug too i.e. now depclean-maven plugin will provide the correct
(desired) results whenever it will encounter the dependent modules inside a multi-module project. In the end, I added
some new tests for the depclean core and all of my code that I have written during GSoC with proper documentation.
Proud to say that, I have successfully achieved all of my goals that I offered to complete during the GSoC period. :tada:

## Contributions :gift: 
If I tell you in short then, upto now I contributed about (3804++  703--) line of code to project depclean out of which before GSoC my
contributed code was of about (453++  109--) lines. It means during the GSoC period I provide a total of (3351++  594--)
lines of code to project depclean.:thumbsup:
